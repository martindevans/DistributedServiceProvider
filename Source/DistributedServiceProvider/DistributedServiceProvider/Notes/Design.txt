Distributed Routing Table
-> Key can be specified or autogenerated, this handles networks where keys have some specific meaning to a specific user and other networks where keys are just arbitrary identifiers.
-> Network ID is a GUID (Globally unique identifier), this allows many networks to be run on the same machine and packets to the networks to be differentiated and routed correctly.

Packets
-> Use protocol buffers
	-> They automatically support upgradeable packet formats
	-> Protocol buffers are extremely densely packed
