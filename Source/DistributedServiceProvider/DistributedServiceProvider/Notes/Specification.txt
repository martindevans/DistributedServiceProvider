To provide a distributed/decentralised way to provde services, supporting a scripting interface to provide a simple way to write new services.

-> Distributed routing Table (A DHT with name resolution, but no data storage) is used for routing
	-> Each DRT node has a unique 256 bit ID
	-> Find the node on the network closest to the given key
-> A single host should be able to support multiple DRTs
-> Each service runs in a DRT which is unique to that service
-> Two distinct DRTs should not merge
-> The network must be tolerant of nodes disappearing with no warning
-> Lookups should be fast
-> Packet formats should be flexible and extensible (so that services can be upgraded without breaking the network)
-> Packets should be small (so that the network is not overloaded with traffic)
